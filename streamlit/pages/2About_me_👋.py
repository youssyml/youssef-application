            My name is Youssef. I am a Systems Engineering graduate with **AI Product Management**
            experience. I fell in love with the **technical challenges** of building **AI products at scale** and decided
            to transition to **ML / Data Engineering**. \n

            I have just finished a **Data Science bootcamp** (Le Wagon) and I am now looking for junior positions in the industry. \n

            Joining Alan as a data full-stack would be the **perfect opportunity** for me to thrive in an ambitious and innovative company
            with a strong tech culture.

            Thank you so much for visiting ! You can reach out to me on **youselouard@gmail.com**.
